Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I am a Software Engineer specializing in web & mobile product development. I currently work at [WillowTree Apps](https://www.willowtreeapps.com), a digital design agency working with members of America's Fortune 500 to build specialized, high quality products.
I've worked with some of the biggest names, like Diary Queen, Pepsi, and T-mobile, as well as smaller startups, like [Protection Zone Management](https://www.pzm-app.com), and I would love to build your product.

I'm an avid outdoorsman, I enjoying hiking and backpacking. I am also a cars enthusiast, trying to track my Focus RS whenever I get the chance.

Please, shoot me an email if you would like any website or mobile work done.
